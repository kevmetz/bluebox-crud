# Bluebox Crud Mongo API

## React / Express / Mongo Atlas

minimal viable crud done in three flavours
1) no state except for list, data read from database every change
2) state for everything, read data once, update data and UI
3) break into components and add drill down props

There is also a fake page for a UI sample area

run:
node backend/server.js
npm start
